<h2>Eray Uzgoren</h2>
<h3 style="font-size:1.2em">Ph.D. University of Florida, 2006</h3>
<p>Eray Uzgoren received his BS from the Mechanical Engineering Department at Middle East Tecnical University, Ankara, Turkey in 1999. He has completed his MS and PHD degrees from the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at University of Florida in 2003 and 2006, respectively. He continued on his research at Aerospace Engineering department at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor as a post-doctorate fellow in 2007, and in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech as a visiting assistant professor from 2007 to 2009. Since 2009, he is currently working in the Mechanical Engineering Program at Middle East Technical University, Northern Cyprus Campus. He received his habilitation from Turkish Higher Education Council (YOK) in February 2014.</p>
<p>His research interest evolves around developing state-of-the-art numerical models that deal with engineering problems involving fluid flows and heat transfer. Recent examples include renewable energy conversion systems: i.e. organic Rankine cycles, solar thermal power systems, ground heat exchangers, and solar energy induced vortex generator. </p>
<p>As part of the EU-FP7 Reintegration project (<a href="cart3Dadapt">cart3Dadapt</a>), he has been developing an object-oriented CFD code in C++; <a href="https://github.com/uzgoren/girdap">girdap</a>. <i>girdap</i> aims to establish interactions between a set of overlapping/non-overlapping domains governed by different conservation laws for complex transport phenomenon. The auto-managed gridding has the capability for anisotropic refinement on body-fitted grids. A new method for advection equation is developed to handle discontinuous features of the transport parameters. </a></p>
