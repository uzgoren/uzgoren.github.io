<p>Currently, I am working on object-oriented multi-physics solver with autonomous grid generation and adaptive mesh refinement capabilities. The solver relies on finite volume method based differential operators and error estimation technique. The advection scheme capable of preserving discontinuities (typical for level set method) is unique to the adaptive mesh refinement technique. The project is part of a EU-FP7 project (cart3Dadapt) and can be downloaded at <a href='https://uzgoren.github.io/girdap'>girdap</a>.</p>
